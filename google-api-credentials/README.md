# Google API Credentials
Place the API credentials you downloaded from the Google Cloud Console here in a file called `credentials.json`

Also, the token genereated by `npm run token:generate` will be saved here in a file called `token.json`

Both files are ignored by git by default, as they contain your private credentials and are specific to your account and MagicMirror setup.
