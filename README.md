## How it will work

The module reads the birthdays of your Google Contacts via Google's People API and exposes them as an iCal Feed through an internal URL, so you can include it in the default calendar.

## Installation

1. In your `modules/` directory, `git clone https://github.com/PalatinCoder/MMM-GoogleBirthdaysProvider.git`
2. `cd` in the new `MMM-GoogleBirthdaysProvider` directory
3. `npm install --production` (note the production flag, so you don't get all the dev dependencies - you don't need them if you just want to use the module)
4. Add the module to your `config.js`:
   ```
   {
       module: "MMM-GoogleBirthdaysProvider",
       config: {}
   },
   ```
   Note: Don't give the module a position, as it doesn't render any DOM at all

5. Add `http://localhost:8080/mmm-googlebirthdaysprovider` to your calendar URLs, something like this:
   ```
   (...)
		{
			module: "calendar",
			position: "top_left",
			config: {
				calendars: [
					{
						url: 'http://localhost:8080/mmm-googlebirthdaysprovider',
						symbol: 'birthday-cake',
						color: '#f00'
					}
				]
			}
		}
   (...)
   ```

## Known Limitations / Issues
* Birthdays are only fetched once, when the node_helper is initialized. Should do that regularly
* By now, all birthday events are set to the current year, thus you won't see next year's birthdays untils new years day
* Only one google account is supported
* there is no pagination implemented for the data returned by Google People API. Thus, the maximum number of contacts available is 2000 (hard limit on google's side).
